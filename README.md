# uwu
## The esoteric programming language nobody asked for.
uwu takes code written in machine code, formatted as u and w.

u is 0

w is 1

To compile the compiler, you will need the D language compiler, then run `dub` in this directory.

## For lawyers
This project is a joke, for a proper license, see LICENSE-human-readable.md

(The main license is still the Buwust license, though.)

# How to use
